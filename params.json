{"name":"EngineKit","tagline":"A game engine wrapper for iOS","body":"### Welcome to EngineKit.\r\nThough still under development, this project's goal is to wrap several frameworks available in iOS (ideally only those made by Apple itself) into one comprehensive system designed make game design as easy as it can be. It's not about reinventing the wheel and adding it to an already huge collection of wheels, it's about taking existing products and bringing them together.\r\n\r\nTo try it out, simply [download a copy of the master branch](https://github.com/vinivendra/MAC0499/archive/master.zip). It usually contains the latest stable version, and should provide you with a project already setup and ready to start development.\r\n\r\nTo participate in development, the [dev branch](https://github.com/vinivendra/MAC0499/tree/dev) is your best bet. It's the project's main branch and where all the 'finished' features go before they are ready to be deployed to `master`. Just fork it, develop away, and create a pull request when your done.\r\n\r\nAny doubts, suggestions and feedback (even negative feedback!) are welcome, whether it is about using the framework or developing it. You can probably reach me at <vinivendra@gmail.com> :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
